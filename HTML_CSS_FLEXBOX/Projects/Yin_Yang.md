## Group Project: Yin-Yang

### Part 1

As a group, pick a theme for your website.  Each teammate will make a page consistent with that theme.  As a group create a landing page with links to all the sub-pages.  

- Spend time designing your page to make a pleasent user experience.
- Create a single Git repository for the code.
  - Throughout this project, make sure all members of the group are writing code in a git branch and using Pull Requests (PRs) to request their code gets merged.
- Use the semantic html, flexbox and other CSS you've been practicing.
- Strive to write clean, readable code that your classmates could read.

### Part 2

To each of your sub-pages you are going to add a link to a different version of the page.  This version of the page presents a whole new user experience, one that is not pleasent. 

- Spend some time thinking about what experiences would be inhibit a user.  Design them into your page
- Make sure your to keep your code clean and readable.  Just change the look and experience of your page.
- Be creative in what you change.  Are there links, hover events or other things that could destroy your user experience.
