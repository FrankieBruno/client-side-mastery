> UX CONCEPT: Web pages should be designed in such a way that they are easy to scan.

How to improve scannability?

- Create visual hierarchies: What is the most important information on the page? What is supportive information? Can you use bulleted lists?
- Use universally accepted conventions: These may include logo/tagline position, buttons/links, social networking options, etc.
- Break a page into clearly defined sections.
- Make it obvious whatâ€™s clickable.

Review the page you just created. Based on the items above, identify some opportunities to improve the UI/UX. Refactor your page to improve the usability. You may add semantic tags, content, and styles.

Background color/image - ensure the copy (text color) has good contrast and is legible. Use the Dev Tools to inspect your color choices.
