## Flexbox Counting

This is a flexbox and CSS practice exercise.  Take the code below and using only css and create a webpage that displays the numbers in order.  You may use the boiler-plate code to get your project started.

```html
  <section class="flex_practice">
    <article class="eight number">Eight</article>
    <article class="two number">Two</article>
    <article class="five number">Five</article>
    <article class="one number">One</article>
    <article class="seven number">Seven</article>
    <article class="ten number">Ten</article>
    <article class="four number">Four</article>
    <article class="three number">Three</article>
    <article class="six number">Six</article>
    <article class="nine number">Nine</article>
  </section>
```

### Challenges

Once you've done that, try these challenges.  All still use CSS only and each should build on the others.

1. Make the numbers adjust to the screen size.
1. Center the numbers on the page.
1. Add a border and center the numbers in the border/box to make them individual card.
1. Make the size of the card displayed for each number the same size.
1. Create a space between the cards on the left/right and the top/bottom.
1. Use other CSS properties to style your cards.  You may do this in any way you like.  Think about color, shadowing, the border style and any other properties you like.
1. Change the background color on hover.
