# Super Flex Coffee House

Your coffee house site is looking great, but you want to take it to the next level.  Do not attemp this chapter until you get the main chapters in Book 1 completed.

Think of components and designs that you see on web pages and try to mimic them. Need inspiration, try these:


## Expand on the coffee house assignment to build more about Nashville pages. 
Include a restaurants page, a parks page, and any other type of things youâ€™d like to highlight in Nashville.

Add a Nav bar to the site that links to each page. Try to get the following Nav styles to work using flexbox.

1. Make all the links stick to the right side of the page.

2. Space the links evenly across the page.

3. Make one link stick to the right and the others to the left.

4. Make one stick to the left and the others to the right.

5. Center the links.

## Add images to the coffee house cards.  

1. Use Flexbox to display one card twice the size of the others.  Repeat for restaurants and parks above.
2. Flex the images so that the text is to one side of the image unless the screen is smaller.
3. Make sure the cards stay flexed and wrap like they do in the base practice.  
4. Add a logo to the nav bar.
5. Make the logo stick on the left side
6. Put the logo between the links and make it 3 times the length as the nav items
7. Practice different design elements of the nav bar using https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-flexbox-common-use-cases/
