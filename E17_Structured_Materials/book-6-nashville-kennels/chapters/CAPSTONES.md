# Capstone Information

## Proposal Documents
The capstone proposal is a conversation with your assigned instructor.  The sections highlighted below make sure you have thought through all aspects of the project. Your instructor will help you flush out any potential problems and make sure the project is scoped appropriately for a 3 week timeline.  

Be prepared for this document to change after meeting with your instructor.  You may need to meet more than once with your instructor.  This is a normal part of the planning process.

**Your instructor must approve your proposal BEFORE you start coding.**

Your proposal should include the following sections:
- Title
- Description
- ERD
- Features
- Wireframe(s)

 
### Title
A basic working title is fine.  It can change, so don't stress about this.

### Description
This should be a paragraph that includes the problem the app solves and why you are passionate about creating it.

### ERD
The ERD can be a link or an image.  It should include all the data you will need.

### Features
This should be a list with a brief description of each feature you want to implement.  Indicate whether each feature is part of the MVP or a stretch goal. 

### Wireframe
Your wireframe can be created by hand or through software.  Share a link, screenshot or picture with your instructor.  

## Requirements
- Use React
- No Games or Calendars
- If you are going to use a 3rd party API, you must show an instructor you can access the data.

## To think about

- Don't dream too big.  Make sure you can complete the project in 3 weeks.
- Keep it simple. It does not need to be ground break.  Don't be afraid to do something that's already been done.
- What problem are you solving/why do you want to make this?
- You will be presenting this to potential employers.  Keep the content professional and not controversial.

## Getting Help
Don't be afraid to ask for help.  When you are stuck, do these things in this order:
- Reference your projects for a similar example
- Do a Google Search - document what you searched/learned
- Ask a teammate to look at your code
- Ask an instructor

## Help During Class Time 
We will create a Slack thread to track the order of who we help.  When you need help and have done all of the above for finding the solution on your own add a message in the thread.
- Give a breif context of your problem.
- If your request is instructor specfic, tag the instructor you need in the tread.
- Either continue to search for a solution or work on part of you capstone that is unrelated until we can get to you. If there are not many people ahead of you, it could be a great time to do a little styling.

We will come find you or Slack you when it is your turn.  

Once you are getting help, please delete your comment in the thread.  This way, the next available instructor will know who to grab.
