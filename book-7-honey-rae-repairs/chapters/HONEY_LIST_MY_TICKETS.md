# Displaying The Right Tickets

This section shows you how to implement another state variable with `useState()` and how to observe ticket state with `useEffect()`. You will see how to display all tickets if an employee is logged in, but only the customer's tickets when a customer in logged in.

Watch the [Filtered State Depending On User Type](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/H3cSeJWbwQyFrXWq01yg) video and then implement the code yourself.
