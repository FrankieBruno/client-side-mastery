# Custom Routing Per User Type

In this chapter, you will see how to support different routes depending on the type of user that has logged into Honey Rae's Repairs application. You will create two new view components - **`EmployeeViews`** and **`CustomerViews`**. One of those components will be returned by **`ApplicationViews`** depending on which type of user is logged in.

Watch the [Routes Per User Type](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/ILD2tDn8tRnepx75Q04o) video and then implement the code yourself.
