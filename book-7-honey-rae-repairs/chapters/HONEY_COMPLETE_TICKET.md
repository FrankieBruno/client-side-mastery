# Finishing Tickets

In this chapter, you will see how to conditionally display a "Finish" button for an employee, who is currently assigned to a ticket, to click and update the `dateCompleted` property on the original service ticket that was created by the customer.

Watch the [Finishing Tickets](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/piH5uYusyOUtIon52tlQ) video and then implement the code yourself.
