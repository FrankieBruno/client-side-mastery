# Ticket Assignments

In this chapter, you will see how to show if a ticket is being worked on by an employee, and how to implement the ability for an employee to claim a ticket.

## Edit for Customers Only

In this section, you need to make sure that a ticket can only be edited by a customer, and you will be making a new **`Ticket`** component that will get 2 props sent to it from the parent **`TicketList`** component.

Watch the [Ticket Component](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/rNGVduucPHi9mQeii65y) video and then implement the code yourself.
