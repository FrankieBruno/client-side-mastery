# Dev Tools

Dev Tools is short for developer tools.  Dev tools are built into the browser and allow you to access information about (and sometimeds manipulate) the code that is running on that page. Software developers use dev tools to track bugs, test solutions and more.  All modern browsers have them, but we are going to focus on using Chrome's dev tools. When you are writting code and testing it in your browser, you should **ALWAYS** have dev tools open even if it feels strange.

There is so much you can do in dev tools, but we are going to start small and just focus on the `Elements` tab for now.

## Opening Dev Tools

There are several ways to open Dev Tools.  Navigate to the webpage you want to inspect and do **ONE** of the following.

1. F12
1. Key combo: Ctrl Shift J (on Windows) or Ctrl Option J (on Mac)
1. right click on the page and select `inspect`

## The Elements Tab

The Elements tab is where you find the HTML that is rendered on the page and each HTML element's CSS.  Not only can you view it, but you can make changes to it as well.  

Take some time to review Chrome's documentation on the Elements Tab. Then practice with your already created projects and/or any webpage you choose!

Note: If something gets too messed up and you want to start over, just refresh your browser and everything should reload for you to start over.
