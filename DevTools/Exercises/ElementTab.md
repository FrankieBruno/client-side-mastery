## Elements Tab Practice

Getting comfortable using Dev Tools will make your life soooooo much easier.  Below are a few challenges designed to help aquaint you.  Feel free to repeat them on different pages and explore more on your own.  

These can be done on ANY webpage, but it is recommended that you complete them on one of your projects first.  You are already familiar with these pages and they have less content.  This helps filter out some of the "noise" of a busy site and allows you to focus on the objective.

Navigate to the page you want to practice on and open your Dev Tools.  

Level 1:

1. Use the inspector to find a HTML element on the page.
1. Change the background color of that element.
1. Change the HTML of the element.  This can be anything as simple as changing the words or creating a whole different element.  
1. Delete that element.

Level 2:

1. Use your coffee house project. Start the server for this project and open your Dev Tools.
1. Select a single card element using the inspector.
1. Change the border of that single card to something different.
1. Change the background color of all the cards
1. Change the margin of the card on 1 or more sides.
1. Change the padding of the card on 1 or more sides.
1. Explore the tab by modifying the CSS in the browser how you wish.  Discover something you like, copy/paste that CSS into your main.css file to update your project!


Level 3: 
1. Use your coffee house project. Start the server for this project and open your Dev Tools.
1. Select a the parent element to the cards using the inspector.
1. Remove the flex property from this element by unchecking the `display: flex` then add it back by rechecking the box.
1. Select a single Coffee House Card and play around with the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `order`, `justify-content` and other flex properties you're interested in.
1. Explore the tab by modifying the CSS in the browser how you wish.  Discover something you like, copy/paste that CSS into your main.css file to update your project!

Level 4: 
1. Navigate to `google.com` and open the Elements Tab in your Dev Tools.
1. Add an h1 element above today's image that says "NSS Rocks!" or replace NSS with your name.
1. Remove, add and restyle as many elements as you like on this page.  Remember that once you refresh your browser, it will all disappear!
