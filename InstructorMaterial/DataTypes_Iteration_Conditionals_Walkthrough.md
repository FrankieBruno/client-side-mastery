## Discussion Group: Data Types, Iteration, Conditionals

Understanding the definitions of string, boolean, int, array and object are important!  Make sure that if someone asks you what the data type of something is, you can answer it.  

Talk about the definitions of string, boolean, int, array and object with examples

Make some strange arrays and objects
  - with all the different data types, including an array
  - with an array of objects
  - with different data types in an array (Note: don't advocate for doing this, just point out JS is sometime too flexible)

Iteration:
  - They did a for...of loop, but feel free to show them forEach and old school (const i = 0, i<10; i++)
  - Make a few examples of iterating

Conditionals
  - Example of a conditional 
  - Example of a conditional in a loop
