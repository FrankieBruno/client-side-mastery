# Algorithmic Thinking Reminder

It is crucial, therefore, that you work on designing the algorithm before you write **any** code. This involves two steps.

## Step 1: Analytical Thinking

1. Which modules should you create?
1. What is the responsibility of each module?
1. What functions should be in which modules?
1. What is the responsibility of each function?
1. What should each function return?

## Step 2: Algorithmic Thinking

1. In which order should you invoke your functions?
2. What data do you need to get from your database when an event listener is triggered?
3. In what order should the data be navigated with `for..of` loops?
4. What is the spcific algorithm for each function? Does the function need parameters? Should it return something?

Do all of this before you write a single line of code, or you could end up wasting hours of time writing code only to find that you need to throw it all away because you didn't design the algorithm first.
