# Tour Data Design

## Learning Objectives

* Identify main resources for your application
* Define tables in an ERD that contain required fields for each resource
* Correctly determine the relationships between the main resources - one to many, or many to many.

## Instructions

Now that you have a visualization of how the project will be presented to the user in the browser, it is time to design the data needed for the project.

1. What are the main resources?
2. What are the properties of each resource?
3. What are the relationships between the resources?

Create an ERD for this application before you write any code. You may want to consult with one of your coaches to make sure you have a good design before you begin implemented the project. An incorrect data design can cost you a significant amount of time if it needs to be corrected after implementation has started.
