## Practice: Display Property of All Toys

You get to pick one of the properties that you would like to display for all three of your toys in your array. Write a `for..of` loop that will iterate your array and use `console.log()` to display that property of each toy.

For example, if you have a `name` property on each toy, try accessing that property with dot notation inside the `for..of` loop and you should see output like this.
