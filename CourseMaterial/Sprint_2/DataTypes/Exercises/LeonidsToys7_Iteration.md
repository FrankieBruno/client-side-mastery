## Iterate Leonid's Toy Catalog

Your job is to display a simple catalog for Leonid's toys. Use string interpolation, dot notation to access object properties and your `for..of` loop to display it.

At this point, we're going to assume that you have properties like `name`, `price`, and `color`. Using those as an example, when you run `node leonids-toys.js` in the terminal, you could display this.

You may have different properties, so use whatever properties you have to build a sample string to be used in the bare bones, terminal-based catalog.
