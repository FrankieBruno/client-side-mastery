# Toy Collection

In this exercise, you will build an array filled with objects. Each item in the array will be one of your toys.

## Practice: Array of Toy Objects

Open your `leonids-toys.js` file again in Visual Studio Code, and re-write it so that the toy objects you created are all contained within a single array. Make sure you assign the array to a variable named `toys`.

After you rewrite the code, put `console.log(toys)` at the end of the code.

```js
const toys = [
    // Add your objects here
]

console.log(toys)
```

To see if you got the syntax correct, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your code file is located.

```sh
cd ~/workspace/toy-objects
```

Then run the following command to see the fruits of your labor.

```sh
node leonids-toys.js
```

If your syntax is correct, you should see your array of objects immediately displayed in the terminal.

If you syntax is incorrect, you will see a lot of gibberish that won't make much, if any, sense. If this happens, check your syntax again, but if you can't make it work, talk to a teammate or an instructor.
