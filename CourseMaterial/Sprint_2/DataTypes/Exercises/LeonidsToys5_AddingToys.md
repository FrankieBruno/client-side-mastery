## Practice: New Toys


1. Create 2 new toy objects after the initial array is created. Give each one a unique `id` property value.
2. Use the `push()` array method twice to add each object to the initial array.
3. Run your code with `node leonids-toys.js` in the terminal.
4. You should now see two new values being displayed in the terminal.
