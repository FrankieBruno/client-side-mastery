## Intro to Data Relationships

Your turn to practice with data structure relationships.  Create two arrays of object from this list of cities and states.  The State should be referenced for each city as an id.

Chicago, IL
Nashville, TN
Los Angeles, CA
Minneapolis, MN
Memphis, TN,
Champagne, IL
San Francisco, CA
Knoxville, TN
Orlando, FL

Not sure what to do, walk through the student example and fill in the cities as students and the states as instructors.
