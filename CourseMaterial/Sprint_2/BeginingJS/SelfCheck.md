## Self Check: Loops and Conditionals

Consider the below array of objects:

```js
const animals = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "monkey",
    country: "Brazil",
    food: "bananas"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "giraffe",
    country: "South Africa",
    food: "Trees"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "wolf",
    country: "United States",
    food: "Animals"
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "Whale",
    country: null,
    food: "fish"
  }
]
```

Complete the following.  You may look over your notes and other code you have written, but please try this on your own first.  

1. Loop over the array and console log each object
1. Create a new loop and this time only console log the name of the animal
1. Create a new loop and this time console log "{ANIMAL NAME} eats {FOOD}" where the words in {} are the object properties.
1. Create a new loop and this time console log "{ANIMAL NAME} is from {COUNTRY}" where the words in {} are the object properties.  If there is no country, console log "{ANIMAL NAME} is not from a country."
