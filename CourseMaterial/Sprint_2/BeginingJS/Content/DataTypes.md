## Learning Objectives

* You should be able to remember the basic data types you will be working with in JavaScript.
* You should be able to describe the data type of different properties of real-world things that you represent in code.

## Describing Data Types

As a software developer, you will always be thinking about data - the type of your data, the structure of your data, the format of your data, and how to display your data to humans in a Web browser. In the beginning of the course, here are the basic data types you will be working with.

## Strings

You will use strings to represent words to be stored in your applications. A string is surrounded by double-quotes.

```js
const firstName = "Emily"
const lastName = "Lemmon"
```

## Numbers

If you store a person's age, or a measurement, or a count of something, you will store it as a number. There are two types of numbers.

### Integers

These are whole numbers: 1, 3, 45, 1024

```js
const applesInTheBasket = 16
```

### Floats

Any fraction represented in decimal format: 1.333, 2.414, 3.14159, 86.75, 309.1

```js
const pi = 3.14159
```

## Booleans

The logical values of `true` and `false`. You will use these values as you might expect in your applications. For example, if you want to track if a user account is currently active or not, you can use `true` if the account is active, or `false` if it is inactive.

```js
const accountIsActive = true
```
