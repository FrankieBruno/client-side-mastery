## Practice: Increasing Leonid's Prices

> Times are tough for Leonid. He's finding that the market for bespoke, artisinal, locally sourced, hand crafted toys doesn't have quite the broad appeal that he thought. He has some loyal customers, but he does have the number of sales each month that he feels he needs to become more profitable.
>
> To account for lower number of sales, he decides to increase the price of all of his toys across the board. After a few months of increased revenue, he believes he will have the cash needed to buy from other distributors and expand his offerings to appeal to a broader audience.
>
> He thinks that having vegan-friendly toys with zero carbon footprint will be the extra appeal needed to start moving more products.


Using the strategy above, modify the current `for..of` loop that displays the toy catalog and increase the price of each toy before it is printed for the terminal-based catalog.

He wants the price of every toy to be inceased by 5%.

For example, here is the current example output for the catalog.

Here's the output if every toy's price is increased by 5%.
