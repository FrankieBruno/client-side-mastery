<h1>Your Terminal</h1>
<p>The terminal is a tool developers use to interact with files both on their local computers and on remote machines.  While it may feel weird first, getting comfortable working in your terminal is imporatant</p>

<h3>Basic Terminal Commands</h3>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<p></p>
<p>List the files in the directory you are currently in.</p>
<p>Navigate to a directory inside the one you are currently in</p>
<P>Navicate to the directory that your current directory is in.</P>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<p>Using your terminal, determine the correct commands to do what is asked.</p>

<h4>White Belt</h4>
<p>Create a directory for Martin's Aquarium name "Martins"</p>

<h4>Yellow Belt</h4>
<p>Navigate into your Martins directory and create the files index.html, main.css and main.js</p>

<h4>Green Belt</h4>
<p>Create directories inside Martins for styles and scripts.  Move the appropriate files into those directories.  Open the directory in VS code and add the boiler plate html to your index.html</p>

<h4>Blue Belt</h4>
<P>Create a directory name practice with two files in it, delete1.html and delete2.html.  First delete only delete1.html then delete the whole directory along with delete2.html in 1 command.</P>

<h4>Red Belt</h4>
<p>Create the directory structure for a project (WHICH ONE?).  Copy the boiler plate code from the Martins project you set-up in the Green Belt exercise.  Read the contents of your html in the terminal.</p>

<h4>Black Belt</h4>
<p>You are tasked with setting up the file directory for a new a project for the zoo.  Your tech lead says there should only be index.html in the root directory.  For everything else, make the appropriate directories.  For this project, your tech lead wants you to separate files based on their function (all js files together, all style files together and all view together)  After sitting down with a senior dev, you know you will need the following files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>main.js</li>
  <li>aquaticAnimals.js</li>
  <li>rainforest.js</li>
  <li>reptiles.js</li>
  <li>pettingZoo.js</li>
  <li>birds.js</li>
  <li>eat.js</li>
  <li>flyingPage.html</li>
  <li>crawlingPage.html</li>
  <li>tropicalPage.html</li>
  <li>interating.html</li>
  <li>waterSpecies.html</li>
  <li>food.html</li>
  <li>swimming.css</li>
  <li>amazon.css</li>
  <li>snacks.css</li>
  <li>snake.css</li>
  <li>touch.css</li>
  <li>air.html</li>
</ul>

<p>Using your terminal on, create the appropriate file structure.</p>

<p>Think about the naming convention.  How could this be improved?  </p>
